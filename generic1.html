							<h1>PROJECTS</h1>
							<h2>Inventory Tracker</h2>
              						<p><strong>Tech stack:</strong>Next.js, React, Firebase<br>
I built a fully functional inventory management system using Next.js and React for the frontend, with Firebase handling backend data storage and real-time updates. The application allows users to add, update, and delete inventory items, with changes reflected instantly thanks to Firebase’s real-time database. I implemented form validation, dynamic UI updates, and state management to ensure a smooth user experience. This project helped sharpen my skills in CRUD operations, React hooks, and Firebase integration, and gave me valuable insight into building scalable single-page applications.</p>
							<h2>AI Customer Support</h2>
							<p><strong>Tech stack:</strong>JavaScript, OpenAI API<br>
I developed an AI-powered customer support chatbot using OpenAI’s GPT models to handle user queries with natural, human-like responses. Initially, I encountered challenges integrating the API and managing request-response flows, especially handling rate limits, token usage, and edge cases like vague or incomplete prompts. Through deep research and debugging, I implemented robust error handling and optimized the request structure to improve performance and accuracy. This project strengthened my understanding of AI integrations, API lifecycle, and building intelligent, context-aware systems.</p>
							<h2>IBM Skillsbuild Application</h2>
							<p><strong>Tech stack:</strong>Spring Boot, JSP, SQL, Spring Security | Group Project<br> This project was developed as part of a group collaboration, where we built a secure and dynamic web application to support users in managing their IBM SkillsBuild learning journey. Our goal was to create a platform that not only tracks course progress but also encourages user engagement through course reviews.<br>
							This collaborative web application helps users manage their IBM SkillsBuild learning journey. Built with secure authentication, it provides a structured dashboard to view and track course progress, as well as a space to share course reviews.<br>My Role & Contributions:</p>
    							<ul>
      							  <li>Designed and implemented the dashboard with categorized tables: Available, Started, and Completed Courses.</li>
      							  <li>Added a real-time progress bar to visualize course completion beneath the tables.</li>
      							  <li>Built the Course Review feature to allow users to leave and view feedback on completed courses.</li>
      							  <li>Integrated Spring Security for login, registration, and access control.</li>
      							  <li>Structured code using MVC with packages: controller, domain, repository, service and config.</li>
    							</ul>
							<p><strong>Team Collaboration:</strong></p>
    							<ul>
      							  <li>Used Git for version control and collaborative development.</li>
      							  <li>Held regular meetings and followed Agile development practices.</li>
      							  <li>Worked together on task breakdown, feature integration, and testing.</li>
    							</ul>
							<p>This project strengthened my skills in secure web development and team collaboration, while deepening my knowledge of Spring Boot and backend architecture.</p>
							<h2>Recipe Intelligence: Data-Driven Recommendation & Taste Prediction</h2>
							<p><strong>Tech stack:</strong>Python, BeautifulSoup, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib | Group Project<br>Developed as part of a team, this project involved building a full data analytics pipeline — from scraping real-world data to deploying machine learning models. We collaborated on designing systems for intelligent recipe recommendations and taste prediction using real cooking data from BBC Food.<br>
							<strong>My Contributions:</strong></p>
							<ul>
    							  <li>Implemented the web scraping engine using BeautifulSoup to extract structured data from dynamic recipe pages.</li>
    							  <li>Led the exploratory data analysis and built visualizations to uncover insights on recipe popularity and rating distributions.</li>
    							  <li>Built a cosine similarity-based recommender system using combined recipe features to deliver personalized suggestions.</li>
    							  <li>Implemented a binary classifier to predict whether a recipe would be considered “tasty” based on its ratings.</li>
    							  <li>Contributed to team code reviews, debugging, and aligning implementation with academic requirements.</li>
  							</ul>
							<p><strong>Key Features of the Project:</strong></p>
  							<ul>
    							  <li>Web Scraping: Automated collection of recipe data from BBC Food into a structured pandas DataFrame and CSV export.</li>
    							  <li>Statistical Analysis: Performed bootstrapped confidence interval estimation and explored rating distributions.</li>
    							  <li>Recommender Systems:
      							    <ul>
        						      <li>Used Cosine Similarity (Vector Space Model) for basic recommendations.</li>
        						      <li>Implemented a second recommendation engine using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).</li>
      							    </ul>
    							  </li>
    							  <li>Evaluation: Compared both engines on <em>coverage</em> and <em>personalisation</em> using test users and qualitative analysis.</li>
    							  <li>Classification: Created a predictive model to determine recipe tastiness using a binary label and tested model accuracy.</li>
  							</ul>
							<h2>Healthcare API and Academic App</h2>
							<p><Strong>Part 1: Hospital Management REST API</Strong><br><strong>Tech Stack: </strong>Java - SpringBoot, MySQL, Postman, OpenAPI3.0 (Swagger)<br>We built a full functional REST API for managing hospital operations, covering patients, doctors, appointments and medical records. The system was designed to reflect real-life data relationships and cascading effects when entities are deleted.</p>
							<li><strong>Key Features:</strong>
								<ul>Full CRUD endpoints for all 4 entities using REST principles.</ul>
								<ul>Complex relationships handled using backend logic:<br>Deleting a patient removes their appointments and records.<br>Deleting a doctor removes their appointments but not patients or records.<br>Deleting an appointment removes the associated medical record.</ul>
								<ul>OpenAPI 3.0 YAML spec created using Swagger Editor for clear documentation of all endpoints, including successful and error responses.</ul>
								<ul>Postman Test Suite: We designed and executed test cases (both success and error) for all 20+ endpoints, validating correctness and error handling.</ul>
								<ul>Spring Boot used to create controller classes like PatientRestController, DoctorRestController, AppointmentRestController, and MedicalRecordRestController using a clean MVC structure.</ul>
							</li>
							<p>This sharpened my backend skills in designing robust APIs, managing data relationships and validating inpot/output using automated testing.</p>
